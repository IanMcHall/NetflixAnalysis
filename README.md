# Netflix Analysis

## Mission:
The purpose of this project is to analyze the history of streaming service Netflix's yearly revenue, cost of operation, profit, and changes in market cap to determine if there is a correlation between this data and the company's recent consideration of cracking down on password sharing. 

## Necessary Packages:
pip install pandas

## Featured Features:
1.Read TWO data files: For this feature, I read in data from two CSV files that were created by exporting SQL databases I had created in MySQL Workbench to CSV files. 
2.Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets:For this feature, I rearanged the order of the data sets so that they would be in chronological order. I also graphed the two datasets together after merging them.
3. Make 3 matplotlib orseaborn (or anotherplotting library): For this feature, I produced three graphs in pandas to easily visualize and analyze the data in question.
4.Build a custom data dictionary: While much of what the data represents in my project may be self explanitory, especially to anyone familiar with finance, I produced and included a data dictionary for reference. This data dictionary can be found as a csv file titled "NET Data Dictionary" that is included with the code.
5.Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md: For this feature, I annotated my code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, wrote clear code comments, and wrote a well-written README.md.
